# Euler's Method of solving DEs
# =============================
#
# The IVP should look like:
# x'(t) = f(t,x) where t belongs to [a,b]
# x(a) = alpha
#
# You should also be given either h (the step-size) or N (the number of sub-intervals)
#
# The solution is approximated by w
#
# The error rate is defined as e_2h/e_h.
# This is calculated by halving h at every iteration and then checking
# the ratio of the previous error to the current one.


# Set these vars with the given information in the problem
# ========================================================
