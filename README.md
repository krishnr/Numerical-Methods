# Numerical Methods
## Krishn Ramesh

This repo contains a bunch of python scripts for running some common numerical methods for solving IVPs (such as those found in SYDE 311).

To run the scripts, download or clone this repo. Open up the script you want to run and enter the problem details where I've commented. To run the script, open up terminal and navigate to where you've downloaded this repo. Then simply run `python $SCRIPT_NAME.py` to get your output.

Feel free to fork and let me know about errors or optimizations through PRs. ðŸ’¯
